VP3 is a tool to assist in the description of a hardware design in Verilog. VP3
can generate module instantiations and signal declarations for you. It provides
a preprocessor function comparable to the C preprocessor, and allows you to
generate portions of your Verilog with embedded perl code.


INSTALLATION

The Parse::Yapp module (available on CPAN) must be installed prior to installing
VP3. If you wish to use the EP3 preprocessor, the Text::EP3 module must be
installed.

If you wish to run the test suite with "make test", Icarus Verilog must be
installed.

VP3 follows the usual perl module install procedure:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test (optional)
	make install

Documentation can be found in Pod format in the main vp3 program.
